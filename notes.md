# My notes

This is what the loop function for java looks like:

for(int a = 0; a < 10; a++) {
System.out.println(a);
}

this is what a collection return looks like:
return List.of(new ChessMove(new ChessPosition(1, 5), new ChessPosition(2, 6), null));
### remember that we need to build the classes out accordingly.
